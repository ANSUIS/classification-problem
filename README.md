Using Classification Algorithms on Breast Cancer Dataset available in the Sklearn library

Loading and Preprocessing
Load the Breast Cancer Dataset: loaded the Dataset Breast Cancer from Sklearn,The dataset contains 30 features and a target variable indicating benign or malignant tumors Handling Missing Values: checked the null values ,info(),describe() drop missing values if any are found , in this dataset there was no missing data or null values Feature Scaling: Implemented StandardScaler, several normalizations and Scaling were executed on the dataset before their use in training to bring uniformity in the range of inputs. Feature Scaling serves to ensure that all of these features contribute fairly in distances algorithms or hyperplane-based functions Handling missing values avoids biased training due to possible insufficient data.

Classification Algorithm Implementation
Implemented the Classification Algorithms

Logistic Regression Logistic Regression works by modeling the probability of the target class using a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds. It is suitable for the breast cancer dataset because of its binary nature, interpretability, and the relatively linear relationships observed in the data.
Decision Tree Classifier It's a good choice for the breast cancer dataset as it handles complex feature interactions and gives interpretable results while requiring minimal preprocessing. Being able to choose the most informative features at every step helps differentiate malignant and benign tumors effectively.
Random Forest Classifier Thus, Random Forest is suitable because it combines the best points of Decision Trees, with the ability to handle such non-linear relationships, by addressing their weaknesses, where it prevents overfitting. It can rank in feature importance and give strong high accuracies, making it such an elegant choice for distinguishing between tumor malignancy and benign ones.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) SVM is suitable for the breast cancer dataset due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data, robustness against overfitting, and capacity to model non-linear relationships through kernels. Proper preprocessing, such as feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning would make SVM very accurate in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) k-NN is a good choice for the breast cancer dataset, as it is easily capable of modeling non-linear decision boundaries, is simple, and has proven effective on small datasets. Proper preprocessing (like feature scaling) and a suitably chosen k make k-NN competitive with other classifiers in terms of performance on distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
Conclusion
